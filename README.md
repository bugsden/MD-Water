# MD-Water
   This project aims to simulate the Molecular Dynamic Simulation of Water with the assistance of the SPC/E(Simple Point Charge/Extended) Water Model. The primary objective is to find the number density and diffusion coeficient of 2992 water molecules. To equilibrate the system we use a thermostat(NVT) and a barostat(NPT), and further while finding the diffusion coefficient we make use of the
